          I have worked mostly with React and JavaScript. Fetching,
          manipulating and displaying data. Aligning buttons and boxes and making things look pretty. Creating oldschool Email templates with HTML for email providers. Finding my way in the React hooks jungle. Knowing how to keep things type safe with TypeScript. I learned how to kill your dear divs, it's not like sprinkling salt on top of your food. If you put too much, it's not good for you. üçï

          I use Figma. Storybook is a home for your components. Making React apps quick
          with Vite! (Never going back to create-react-apps!) Did write tests with Vitest, and React Testing Library to catch those little bugs! Tracking issues in Sentry. Knowing that Cypress does not stand only for a tree. üßê

          Currently learning GraphQL queries and mutations and RTK (Redux
          Toolkit) for state management. Honing my JS skills. Lately been busy with Cypress and PHP. Learning never ends says the wise one. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
